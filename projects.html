<h1>Twenty Minute Neighborhoods Detroit - Analysis Using ArcGIS</h1>
<p>In this project I used the software ArcGIS to spatially analyze data and make reccommendations for urban planning.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The United States was the birthplace of the automotive industry and it has continued to shape the culture and lifestyle of Americans today. In addition to the cost of owning and fueling a car, the amount of passenger vehicles also poses threats to the environment and human health. Moving forward, it is clear that steps must be taken to decrease America dependence on private vehicles for transportation. Unfortunately, urban sprawl and population shift to the suburbs has increased distances and made walking and using public transport for destinations more difficult. However, cities are taking steps to make car-less lifestyles more feasible.</p>
<p>The concept of twenty-minute neighborhoods has emerged in cities across the country as a way to meet this need. These neighborhoods provide citizens with access to amenities like grocery stores, restaurants, parks, and schools all within an easy walk. Recently the city of Detroit proposed converting areas into these twenty-minute neighborhoods. Mayor Duggan proposed three areas as candidates for his twenty-minute neighborhood plan: Fitzgerald around McNichols/Livernois, Southwest near Clark Park, and West Village. For my project, I looked at what amenities already exist in these areas and what improvements would need to be made in order for them to qualify as a twenty-minute neighborhood.

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
    After acquiring all necessary data, I looked at the presence of amenities in each  neighborhood. I simply noted whether or not a particular feature was contained within the boundaries of a neighborhood. If at least one instance of the feature was present, I considered it accessible to the residents. While this is not a perfect method, it allowed me to see what features were present and missing from the immediate areas.

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
    Out of the three neighborhoods analyzed, only Southwest met my criteria for being an adequate twenty-minute neighborhood. Overall, each neighborhood contained several transit stops. However, this is not completely indicative of access since the needs of residents for different routes and times will vary. Grocery stores seemed to be the most sparsely distributed feature that I looked at, with both West Village and Fitzgerald lacking a store within their boundary. This could be due to the fact that I limited grocery stores to only full operations and not convenience shops that still offer food, just with less healthy varieties and higher prices. Only Southwest contained all necessary features for my twenty-minute neighborhood designation.
